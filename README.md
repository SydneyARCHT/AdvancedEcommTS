# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Advanced E-Commerce Frontend Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Advanced React E-Commerce Web Application project! This application showcases a complete e-commerce platform with user management, product catalog, shopping cart functionality, and more. Built using React, Redux Toolkit, and React Query, this project demonstrates advanced React concepts and best practices.

## Features

  - Utilize local storage to maintain the cart state between sessions.

- **Technologies Used**:
  - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
